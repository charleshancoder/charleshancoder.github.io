title: "PARaM: A Framework for Quick Assessment of Software Tools"
---

I have been using software tools for a long time. Not just for my day-to-day coding tasks but also for things like writing design docs and researching. I have used a lot of tools and frameworks over the years and I have found that some tools are better than others. I have also found that some tools are better suited for certain tasks than others.

PARaM is a framework that I have developed to help me quickly assess software tools or libraries. It stands for Problem, Alternatives, Restrictions, and Maturity. I use this framework to quickly evaluate a software tool or library and decide whether it is suitable for my needs.

## Problem (Purpose)

The first step in the PARaM framework is to find out what problem this tool or library is trying to solve. This step is important because it allows you to understand the purpose of the tool and whether it is suitable for your needs.

When identifying the problem that the tool is trying to solve, you should consider the following questions:

- What is the tool or library designed to do?
- What are the key features of the tool or library?
- What are the use cases for the tool or library?

By answering these questions, you can quickly get an idea of whether the tool is suitable for your needs.

## Alternatives

The next step in the PARaM framework is to identify alternative solutions to the problem. This step is important because it allows you to compare different tools and libraries and choose the one that best fits your needs.

When identifying alternatives, you might come cross tools that you are already familiar with. This will give you some quick ideas what the new tool can do and how it compares to the tools you are already using. You should also consider the pros and cons of each alternative and how they compare to each other.

## Restrictions (limitations)

The third step in the PARaM framework is to identify any restrictions that you have when choosing a software tool or library. For example, you might have restrictions on the programming language that you can use, the operating system that you are running on, or the license that the software tool or library is released under.

The question you should ask yourself is: "What this tool or libarary is not?" This will help you understand the limitations of the tool and whether it is suitable for your needs.

## Maturity

The final step in the PARaM framework is to assess the maturity of the software tool or library. This step is important because it allows you to evaluate whether the tool is stable and well-maintained.

When assessing the maturity of a software tool or library, you should consider the following factors:

- How long has the tool been around?
- How active is the development community?
- How many open issues are there on the project's issue tracker?
- How frequently are new releases made?

By considering these factors, you can get a good idea of whether the tool is mature and whether it is suitable for your needs.

## Using the PARaM Framework with Generative AI

Now that you have an understanding of the PARaM framework, you can use it to quickly assess software tools or libraries. You can also use the framework with generative AI tools to quickly gather information about a software tool or library.

One of the AI tools that I have used is [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai/), which is a generative AI tool that searches the web for information then generates a summary of the information. I have used Perplexity to quickly gather information about software tools and libraries and then used the PARaM framework to evaluate whether the tool is suitable for my needs.

For example, I recently tried to evaluate .NET Aspire, that I have never used before. I used Perplexity to gather information about .NET Aspire and then used the PARaM framework to quickly assess whether it is suitable for my needs.
