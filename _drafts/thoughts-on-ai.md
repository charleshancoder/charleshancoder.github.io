title: "Random Thoughts on AI"
---

ve been using AI for some time. Not just for my daybto day cosing tasks but also things like writing design docs and researching.

## Is AI just another tool?

The short answer is yes. When i used the intell sesen in VS back the days, i found it was so useful but now i rearly usenit because Copilot predicts what my code does.

However, for AI to work accurately it needs to know more context. As a developer i have more context in terms of the business requirements and technical requirements in a particular task than Copilet which only knows what it can see in the code. 

The long answer is no, AI will be able to do more when it gets more information from the real world.

## Will software enginner be replaced by AI?

For the job title yes but for engineers who knows how to leverage AI to solve complex business problems you can do more than ever. 

My observation is that there are engineers who focus more on the technical side, the ones who knows more for the business problems and the good ones are who knows the both world very well.


## What's left for my kids if AI took the jobs?

I think the future is bright for the kids. They will be able to do more than we can do now. They will be able to solve more complex problems and they will be able to do more things that we can't do now.

For example, my kids asked me how the area of circle is calculdated, I was able to just tell them the formula 
$$
A = \pi r^2
$$
but he kept asking where does this formula come from. I was able to tell him that it was discovered by the ancient Greeks but I couldn't tell him how they discovered it.

So i turned to ChatGPT and ask it to create an animation in HTML and Javascript to show how the area of circle is calculated. It was able to create a simple animation that shows how the area of circle is derived by considering a circle as the limit of a sequence of regular polygons with an increasing number of sides.

I think this is a good example of how AI can help kids learn more than we can teach them.
