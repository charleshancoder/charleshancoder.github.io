title: API First vs Code First
---

When it comes to building APIs, there are two common approaches: API First and Code First. Each has its own advantages, and knowing when to use which approach can have a big impact on your development workflow. In this post, we’ll break down the differences between API First and Code First, highlight when to use each, and dive into a real-world case study of how we successfully implemented API First to build an API platform.

## What Is API First?

API First is a design-first approach where the API contract is defined before any code is written. The contract outlines key details like endpoints, request and response formats, and error codes, typically written in standards like OpenAPI, RAML, or API Blueprint.

### Advantages of API First

- **Better Design**: Focusing on the API contract upfront ensures that the API is well thought out in terms of design and usability, without getting bogged down by implementation concerns.
  
- **Faster Development**: Once the API contract is defined, both frontend and backend teams can work in parallel. Backend development doesn’t need to wait for the frontend, and vice versa.

- **Improved Collaboration**: Having a clear API contract fosters better collaboration between stakeholders, including developers, designers, and external partners. Everyone has a shared understanding of the API’s requirements.

- **Easier Testing**: With the API contract in place, you can generate mock servers and clients for testing, speeding up the QA process and reducing potential issues during development.

## What Is Code First?

Code First, on the other hand, takes a development-first approach. In this method, you start by writing the code, and from that code, the API contract is generated using tools like Swagger or OpenAPI Generator.

### Advantages of Code First

- **Faster Prototyping**: Code First allows you to jump into coding immediately, making it ideal for quickly prototyping APIs without worrying about drafting the API contract upfront.
  
- **Easier Maintenance**: Since the contract is generated from the code, it minimizes the risk of discrepancies between the code and the API documentation.

- **Better Tooling**: Code First frameworks offer powerful tools that help generate not just the API contract, but also documentation, client libraries, and server stubs, making the process more efficient.

## When to Use API First

API First is the better option in the following scenarios:

- **New API Development**: If you’re designing an API from scratch and need to focus on the design and user experience, API First provides a more structured approach.
  
- **Multiple Teams**: When different teams are involved in the API development process, API First helps ensure everyone is on the same page and working toward the same goals.
  
- **External Collaboration**: If external partners will consume the API, having a well-defined contract from the outset ensures clarity and better collaboration.

## When to Use Code First

Code First is more appropriate when:

- **Rapid Prototyping**: If you’re quickly iterating on a new feature or need to get something working fast, Code First allows for more flexibility.
  
- **Building on Existing Code**: If the API is an extension of an existing system, it often makes sense to write the code first and generate the API contract afterward.

- **Smaller Projects**: In small projects where a single developer is responsible for both the API design and implementation, Code First can simplify the process.

## Case Study: Building an API Platform with API First

At work, we embarked on building an API platform that enables developers to create, publish, and manage APIs. We opted for the API First approach for a few key reasons.

First, we had external partners consuming the APIs, so it was critical to have a well-defined API contract that was easy to understand and use. To achieve this, we started by drafting the API contract using OpenAPI.

Once the contract was finalized, we leveraged OpenAPI Generator to create server stubs. These stubs, built using ASP.NET Core, provided a foundation for the development team to start implementing the actual API endpoints and business logic.

On the client side, we published the API contract to a developer portal, allowing developers to explore and test the APIs with mocked responses. This approach enabled us to build the platform efficiently while ensuring that the API met both technical and business requirements.

### Key Takeaways from Our Experience:

- **Parallel Development**: Thanks to the API contract, both the frontend and backend teams could work in parallel without waiting on each other.
  
- **Seamless Collaboration**: The shared API contract facilitated smooth communication between internal teams and external partners, ensuring everyone had the same understanding of how the API should work.
  
- **Faster Delivery**: The use of server stubs and mock testing helped accelerate the development process while reducing the risk of integration issues down the road.

## Conclusion

Both API First and Code First have their strengths, and the right choice depends on the specific requirements of your project. For new APIs that require careful design, especially when working with multiple teams or external partners, API First is the way to go. If you're focused on rapid prototyping or extending an existing codebase, Code First can offer a faster, more flexible solution.

Understanding the context of your project and its stakeholders will help you decide which approach to take. Whichever you choose, having a well-defined process and leveraging the right tools will lead to more efficient development and better API outcomes.
