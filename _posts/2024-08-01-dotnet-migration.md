title: "Migrating from .NET Framework to .NET 8"
---

As part of our ongoing efforts to modernize our software stack, we’re preparing to migrate several of our applications built with .NET Framework 4.7.2 to .NET 8. This upgrade will allow us to leverage the latest features, security improvements, and performance optimizations that .NET 8 brings to the table.

In this post, I'll walk through our migration strategy, outlining the key steps and considerations involved in moving a .NET Framework application to .NET 8.

## Why Are We Migrating to .NET 8?

There are several compelling reasons for making this transition:

- **Performance Gains**: .NET 8 offers significant runtime improvements and optimizations, which will help make our applications faster and more efficient.
  
- **Enhanced Security**: The framework includes improved security features and stronger support for modern security protocols, which is critical in today’s landscape.
  
- **Containerization Support**: With its robust support for containerization and cloud-native development, .NET 8 makes deploying applications in containers and cloud platforms more straightforward and efficient.

## Our .NET Migration Strategy

We’ve developed a structured migration plan that will help us tackle this process efficiently and minimize risks. Here's a breakdown of the steps we’re following:

### 1. **Assessment**
We start by assessing our existing .NET Framework applications. This involves identifying any third-party libraries, dependencies, and custom components that may need to be updated or replaced before the migration.

### 2. **Compatibility Check**
Next, we check for compatibility with .NET 8. Tools like the .NET Portability Analyzer come in handy here, helping us analyze how much of our current codebase is compatible and identifying areas that require adjustments.

### 3. **Migration Plan**
Once we understand the scope of work, we create a detailed migration plan. This document outlines the steps involved, resources needed, timelines, and potential dependencies. Having a solid plan in place helps ensure that everyone is aligned and that we can handle issues as they arise.

### 4. **Pilot Migration**
Before going all-in, we’ll run a pilot migration with one of our smaller applications. This allows us to identify potential challenges and fine-tune the process before tackling the larger projects. The pilot will help ensure that we’ve accounted for edge cases and unexpected issues.

### 5. **Full Migration**
With the pilot's success, we’ll move on to the full migration. We'll follow the migration plan step by step, making sure that any lessons learned from the pilot are applied to streamline the process.

### 6. **Testing**
After migration, we’ll perform rigorous testing to ensure that the applications run as expected. This includes testing for performance, security, and overall compatibility to guarantee that nothing breaks during the transition.

### 7. **Deployment**
Once testing is complete, we’ll deploy the migrated applications to production. As always, we’ll closely monitor performance and functionality in the live environment, ready to address any issues that crop up post-deployment.

## Conclusion

Migrating from .NET Framework to .NET 8 is a complex but rewarding process. With careful planning and a phased approach, we can minimize disruptions while unlocking the benefits of improved performance, security, and modern development practices. By following this structured migration strategy, we aim to ensure a smooth transition and future-proof our applications for the long term.
